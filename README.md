# Keepr

Keepr is a social media app that is similar in function to Pintrist.

### Features

Users are able to share "keeps" which are posts that consist of a picture and description. These keeps are displayed for all to see in a masonry layout in the home page of the application and when clicked, launches a modal with more information on that keep. 

Once a user is logged in, they are able to create "vaults" which can be either public or private. vaults are essentially collections of keeps and users can add their own, or other user's keeps into their vaults. Private vaults can only be viewed by the creator of the vault. 

Every user has a profile page where their public vaults are displayed along with any keeps they've posted.


### Creating the app

Keepr was built using Vue.js, .net C#, and MySQL. This was my first full-stack application that I built using C# and MySQL and was a great learning experience. I also had the opportunity to utilize a view model which was both exciting and challenging.
